# hss-doc

This repository contains the documentation for our project. The documentation is
written in HTML and contains all function and class descriptions.

### Notes
We ran into trouble with auto-generating our documentation. We tried to use
JSDoc3, but it did not work as expected and ended up generating empty documentation
(possibly because our application was written in React.js) and we could not find
a solution to this problem. We therefore decided to write the documentation
manually.
